### Project: WedFast

WedFast is a program that aims to help users plan their wedding efficiently by organising
the contacts of all the parties involved. These contacts include important details for a
wedding such as pricing, attendance status, and foundational components such as name, email, address, and phone number. 
The program is a desktop based application created using JavaFX GUI, and users work with the CLI to 
input/manage their contact details.

List of my Contributions:

* **Implemented Enhancements**:
     * Add Price component to every Person: When a new person is added as a contact by the user,
       the user can opt to include the pricing that person's potential service amounts to.
         * Benefits: For parties such as caterers, photographers, attire organisers, noting their price points
          is a critical aspect of wedding planning that should not be overlooked and improves the user's decision-making.
         * Outcome: Allows for identification between paid and non-paid groups.
         * Difficulty of implementation: Medium
     * Add Info component to every Person: The user can add any important information for each contact
      when adding/editing them.
         * Benefits: For example, if the contact can only communicate with the user during a certain period of the day,
           adding the information will prevent the user from forgetting it.
         * Outcome:  Makes the Person (each contact) more nuanced.
         * Difficulty of implementation: Easy
     * Add status component to every Person: the user can add/update the status of each contact as frequently as they please. 
         Visibly displays Green, Yellow or Red on the text to indicate confirmed/pending or declined status.
         * Benefits: Allows the user to know at all times who is and is not attending and keep their priorities in check.
         * Outcome: Increases the meaningfulness of certain contacts.
         * Difficulty of implementation: Medium
     * Add undo command: This command helps to undo the most previous command
         * Summary of commands that can be undone: add, delete (by index, name or tag), clear, group, edit
         * Benefits: Any accidental command implemented can be undone quickly
         * Outcome: Adds to the list of the commands 
         * Difficulty of implementation: Very Hard
